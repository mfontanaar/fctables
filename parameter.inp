odir = 'tables'   ! Output directory.
d    = 5          ! Number of matching points in physical domain.
c    = 25         ! Number of continuation points to use.
!neum = 1          ! Create tables for Neumann boundary conditions.
!                  ! 0 creates tables only for Dirichlet conditions.

! This parameters are optional and can be left blank.
! In that case, the code will make educated guesses.
! Use only in case of convergence problems.
&option
z    =         ! Points in the zero region.
o    =         ! Oversampling factor.
bw   =         ! Bandwith reduction.
e    =         ! Grid extension points (points after zero region).
