&required
odir = 'tables' ! Output directory.
d    = 9        ! Number of matching points in physical domain.
c    = 33       ! Number of continuation points to use.
neum = 0        ! =0 creates projector for Dirichlet boundary condition
!               ! and if compiled with BLEND=yes the blend-to-zero operator.
!               ! =1 creates projector for Neumann BC.
!               ! =2 creates projector for second normal derivative BC.
!               ! =3 creates projector for Robin BC with hardcoded parameter.

! This parameters are optional and can be left blank.
! In that case, the code will try to make educated guesses.
! Use only in case of convergence problems.

z    =         ! Points in the zero region.
o    =         ! Oversampling factor.
bw   =         ! Bandwith reduction.
e    =         ! Grid extension points (points after zero region).
